# Current-Mode Control of a Distributed Buck Converter with a Lossy Transmission Line

This project contains the Scilab source files for the high level simulation of a distributed buck converter with a lossy transmission line. In addition, we provided the details for a circuit simulation using LTspice<sup>&reg;</sup> from Amalog Devices Inc.

## Prerequisites

You need to install the open source software Scilab. This software for engineers and scientists is available for several operating systems:

<https://www.scilab.org/>

Our simulations were carried out with Scilab 2024.

The circuit simulations were carried out with LTspice<sup>&reg;</sup>:

## Contents

The [src](src) directory contains the source Scilab and Xcos files as well as the schematics files.

### Parameters and Constants

The file [context.sce](src/context.sce) contains the parameter values and constants for the simulation. It is called by the other script files.

### Step Response

The Scilab script file [sim-step.sce](src/sim-step.sce) calls the Xcos scheme [sim-step.zcos](src/sim-step.zcos).

### PWM Excitation

The Scilab script file [sim-pwm.sce](src/sim-pwm.sce) calls the Xcos scheme [sim-pwm.zcos](src/sim-pwm.zcos).
