## Prerequisites

You need to install the open source software Scilab. This software for engineers and scientifsts is available for several operating systems:

https://www.scilab.org/

Our simulations were carried out with Scilab 2024.

## Contents

The [src](src) directory contains the source Scilab and Xcos files.

### Parameters and Constants

The file [src/context.sce](context.sce) contains the parameter values and constants for the simulation. It is called by the other script files.

### Step Response
