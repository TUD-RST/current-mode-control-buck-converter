## Prerequisites

You need to install the open source software Scilab. This software for engineers and scientifsts is available for several operating systems:

https://www.scilab.org/

Our simulations were carried out with Scilab 2024.

## Contents

The [src](src) directory contains the source Scilab and Xcos files.

### Parameters and Constants

The file [context.sce](src/context.sce) contains the parameter values and constants for the simulation. It is called by the other script files.

### Step Response

The Scilab script file [sim-step.sce](src/sim-step.sce) calls the Xcos scheme [sim-step.zcos](src/sim-step.zcos).

### PWM Excitation

The Scilab script file [sim-pwm.sce](src/sim-pwm.sce) calls the Xcos scheme [sim-pwm.zcos](src/sim-pwm.zcos).

### Frequency Responses

The Scilab script file [amplitude1.sce](src/amplitude1.sce) visualizes the amplitude frequency responses for the different converter models:

The Scilab script file [amplitude2.sce](src/amplitude2.sce) visualizes the open loop amplitude frequency responses for the conventional converter with and without controller:
